  #root 'static_pages#index' #The first root entry defines which page will be shownwhen the application receives a request without a path (i.e. hocalhost:3000)
  
  root 'static_pages#landing_page' #This root will be ignored because the root to 'static_pages#index is first in line. // Sets the root of the rails app to the controller static_pages and the landing page. The controller for the static page needs to be referenced in the routes.rb file like this. Otherwise, the user cannot access the page.
